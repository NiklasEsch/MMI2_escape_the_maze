      Escape the Maze
    </h1>
    <p>
      This is a cooperative game that is played by two players. One player
      (player#1) is situated in a virtual environment (wearing a VR-headset) which contains a
      maze that he or she must find the fastest way through. The other player (player#2) plays on
      a smartphone, tablet or on a PC and sees the same maze from a top-down perspective. Therefore
      player#2 can search for a good route through the maze. By placing landmarks in the maze on his
      or her device player#2 creates flying landmarks the virtual maze, which
      can then be seen by player#1. Only 10 landmarks can be placed at once, but you can delete a landmark by clicking it.
      Then it can be placed somewhere else. This way player#2 navigates player#1 through the maze.
      Keep in mind, that there are coins to be collected and monsters
      blocking the way and must be bribed or evaded. These coins and monsters are solely
      visible to player#1, so player#2 must adapt his or her planned route according to the
      feedback of player#1. When the VR player is in the close vicinity of coins or monsters player#2 can collect the coins
      or bribe the monster with a click of a button that is going to appear. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible and escape the maze
      before the time runs out.
